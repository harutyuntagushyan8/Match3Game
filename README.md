# Simple Match3 Game

## In this game we use SFML library with XCode.

## Steps to install SFML are`
- First of all you need to download the SFML SDK which is available on the [download page](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

- Copy the content of Frameworks to /Library/Frameworks and and copy the content of include to /usr/local/include.

- SFML depends on a few external libraries on macOS. Copy the content of extlibs to /Library/Frameworks.

- This feature is optional but I strongly recommend that you install it. Copy the SFML directory from templates to /Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates (create the folders if they don't exist yet).
